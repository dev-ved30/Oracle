Oracle Documentation
====================

**Oracle** is a modular and extensible framework for hierarchical classification of astronomical transients.  
It provides a set of tools for model training, evaluation, and inference on large-scale time-domain survey data.

Overview
--------

Time-domain astronomy is entering an era of unprecedented data volumes from surveys such as
the **Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)**. Rapid, accurate, and hierarchical classification
of transients is critical for triggering timely follow-up observations.

**Oracle** is designed to:

- Perform **hierarchical transient classification** across multiple taxonomic levels.
- Ingest light curve data from major surveys with minimal preprocessing.
- Support pre-trained models for immediate inference.
- Allow researchers to retrain or extend models with custom data.
- Provide clear visualization and evaluation utilities.

1) Installation
---------------

Installation can be done via cloning the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/dev-ved30/Hierarchical-VT.git
   cd Hierarchical-VT
   pip install -e .

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The package relies on common scientific Python libraries such as:
`numpy`, `scipy`, `torch`, `astropy`, and `matplotlib`.  
A full list can be found in ``requirements.txt``.

---

2) Quick Start
--------------

Once installed, you can classify light curves using a pretrained model:

**For LSST (via ELAsTiCC)**

.. code-block:: python

   from astropy.table import Table
   from oracle.pretrained.ELAsTiCC import ORACLE1_ELAsTiCC, ORACLE1_ELAsTiCC_lite

   table = Table.read('notebooks/AGN_17032813.ecsv')

   model = ORACLE1_ELAsTiCC()
   model.score(table)
   model.predict(table)
   model.predict(table)

   model = ORACLE1_ELAsTiCC_lite()
   model.score(table)
   model.predict(table)
   model.predict(table)

**For BTS**

.. code-block:: python

   from astropy.table import Table
   from oracle.pretrained.BTS import ORACLE1_BTS

   table = Table.read('notebooks/fake_SN.ecsv')

   model = ORACLE1_BTS()
   model.predict(table)
   model.score(table)
   model.embed(table)

The output is a hierarchical class probability distribution for each level of the taxonomy.

For more examples, see the ``notebooks`` directory in the repository.
