        Compute latent space embeddings from the given batch of inputs.

        Processes time-series, static, and postage stamp inputs to produce a latent representation.
        The function performs the following steps:
            - Packs the padded time-series data using the sequence lengths provided.
            - Processes the time-series data with a bidirectional GRU and extracts its last hidden state.
            - Processes the postage stamp data through a Swin-based module and a fully connected layer.
            - Transforms the GRU and static features through separate dense layers with non-linear activation.
            - Concatenates the processed time-series, static, and postage stamp features.
            - Passes the merged representation through additional dense layers with activation functions to yield the final latent space embedding.
